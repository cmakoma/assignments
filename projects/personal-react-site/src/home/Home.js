            <p>SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket 
                to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008),[12][note 1] the first private company to successfully
                 launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private company t
                 o send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012),[14] the f
                 irst propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse 
                 of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private company to launch a
                 n object into orbit around the sun (Falcon Heavy's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018). 
                 SpaceX has flown 16 resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS) under a 
                 partnership with NASA.[15] NASA also awarded SpaceX a further development contract in 2011 
                 to develop and demonstrate a human-rated Dragon, which would be used to transport astronauts 
                 to the ISS and return them safely to Earth.[16] SpaceX conducted the maiden launch of its 
                 Crew Dragon spacecraft on a NASA-required demonstration flight on March 2, 2019 and is 
                 set to launch its first crewed Crew Dragon later in 2019.[17]
