        <h1>Importance of networking with social media</h1>
        <p>Social media are interactive computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas,
             career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks.[1] The variety of stand-alone and built-in 
             social media services currently available introduces challenges of definition; however,
              there are some common features:[2]</p>
        <p>Users typically access social media services via web-based technologies on desktops and laptops, or download services that offer 
            social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). As users engage with these electronic services, 
            they create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, 
            and modify user-generated content or pre-made content posted online.</p>

        <p>Networks formed through social media change the way groups of people interact and communicate. 
            They "introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between organizations, communities, 
            and individuals."[1] These changes are the focus of the emerging fields of technoself studies. Social 
            media differ from paper-based media (e.g., magazines and newspapers) and traditional electronic media 
            such as TV broadcasting in many ways, including quality,[5] reach, frequency, interactivity, usability, 
            immediacy, and performance. Social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system (many sources 
            to many receivers).[6] This is in contrast to traditional media which operates under a monologic t
            ransmission model (one source to many receivers), such as a newspaper which is delivered to many
             subscribers, or a radio station which broadcasts the same programs to an entire city. Some of the most 
             popular social media websites, with over 100 million registered users, include Facebook (and its associated 
             Facebook Messenger), Instagram, Google+, Myspace, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, Viber, VK,
              WeChat, Weibo, Baidu Tieba, and Wikia.</p>
