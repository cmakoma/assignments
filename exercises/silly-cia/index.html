    <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector<br> 
            General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands<br>
            of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the <br>
        most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines<br>
        impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's<br>
        inception in 1947.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know<br> 
        the particulars of several historic events, such as:
